# ALFWorld Embodied Agent Skill

## Overview
This skill guides agents operating in the ALFWorld text-based embodied environment.
The agent must complete household tasks by navigating rooms, interacting with objects,
and using appliances. Actions must be chosen from the admissible action list provided
at each step.

**Output format**: Return exactly one XML-style element named `action`.
Its text content must be one command copied verbatim from the current admissible action list.
Do not include any text outside this element or any nested elements.

## Task Types

| Type | Goal | Key Steps |
|------|------|-----------|
| Pick & Place | Put object X in/on receptacle Y | Find X -> take X -> go to Y -> put X in/on Y |
| Pick Two & Place | Put two instances of X in/on Y | Find X1 -> take -> place -> find X2 -> take -> place |
| Examine in Light | Examine object X under desklamp | Find X -> take X -> find desklamp -> use desklamp |
| Clean & Place | Clean object X and put in/on Y | Find X -> take X -> go to sink -> clean X -> go to Y -> put X |
| Heat & Place | Heat object X and put in/on Y | Find X -> take X -> go to microwave -> heat X -> go to Y -> put X |
| Cool & Place | Cool object X and put in/on Y | Find X -> take X -> go to fridge -> cool X -> go to Y -> put X |

## General Principles

1. **Decompose the task**: Parse the goal into ordered sub-goals (locate, acquire, transform, deliver). Complete each before moving to the next.
2. **Systematic exploration**: While empty-handed and searching for a goal object that is not yet visible or reachable, treat every listed surface and container as a possible search location, including shelves, countertops, tables, desks, dressers, side tables, and closed containers. If the admissible actions include a `go to` command for any receptacle you have not yet inspected, choose one of those unvisited receptacles instead of going to an already inspected receptacle whose contents are unchanged. A closed receptacle counts as unvisited until you open it and inspect it, so open it before judging it empty. Revisit an inspected receptacle only if its state or contents have changed since inspection, or if no unvisited receptacle remains. Once the goal object is visible and reachable, or once you are carrying a goal object that needs treatment or delivery, this search preference no longer applies: take it if needed and proceed directly to the required treatment and destination.
3. **Grab immediately**: When a required object is visible and reachable, take it right away before moving elsewhere.
4. **Transform before placing**: If the task requires cleaning, heating, or cooling, perform the state change at the appropriate appliance before heading to the final destination.
5. **Direct delivery**: Once holding the transformed (or untransformed) goal object, navigate straight to the target receptacle and place it.
6. **Track progress**: Maintain an internal count of how many objects still need to be found and placed. Only stop searching when the count reaches zero.
7. **Avoid loops**: Never repeat the same action more than twice in a row. If stuck, move to a different unexplored location.
8. **Only choose admissible actions**: Always pick an action from the admissible action list. Do not invent actions.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Revisiting searched locations**: Keep track of which surfaces/containers have been checked; do not re-examine them unless their state or contents have changed or no unvisited receptacle remains.
- **Ignoring visible objects**: If the target object appears in the observation, pick it up immediately.
- **Skipping state changes**: Do not place an object at the destination without first cleaning/heating/cooling it when required.
- **Premature termination**: Do not stop the episode until all goal conditions are verified as met.
- **Action loops**: Repeatedly toggling or examining the same object wastes steps. Move on to new locations instead.
